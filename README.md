# FMAD Mini Project 
### We create a ToDo List App in which there are different tasks like 
### 1. Home Screen: Display a list of tasks with a checkbox for completion. 
### 2. Add Task: Use a form to add a new task with task name and due date. 
### 3. Mark Complete/Delete: Update the UI dynamically when tasks are marked complete or deleted. 
### 4. Filter Tasks: Add tabs to filter tasks (All, Completed, Pending).
